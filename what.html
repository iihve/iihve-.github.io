        <h4>As I am about to finish riding my first mountain I see a different horizon ahead</h4>

        <div class="paragraph1">

            <p>
                I found that the horizon holds many mountains more to be ride, I'm about to pass this class<br>
                with a different feeling that the one I had before, because I have intellectual grown in this <br>
                short period of time on a different way, I don it myself I see now that by choosing to learn <br>
                how to be fluent in the knowledge of technologies by sand boxing code and learning to use tools <br>
                like UML diagrams I have prepared myself to write code, I'm still in the beginning stage, but <br>
                I'm here prepared to be more, in fact I'm better prepare to defend my ideas and concepts <br>
                because I have work hard to learn them, and I know I will keep learning new concepts <br><br>

                Having had the experience of working with an adviser that has become a mentor has opened  <br>
                my eyes to a different way of cooperation in a seance of a professional seating, I can <br>
                work with others listening on what they have to contribute, but I can cooperate too because<br>
                I have things to contribute too, as I know there are much more things to learn, and I'm excited <br>
                about that the initial fear has transformed into a challenge, and I'm eager to see were <br>
                the next mountain will lead me to.
