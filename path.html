            <p>
                This has been a time to change for me, not only the change that comes with new knowledge,<br>
                but a change in the way I am. I have seen a grout in many ways I fell more independent and in <br>
                control of my own learning path.<br> <br>

                I discover that I should not be scare of not knowing how to be a programmer, I may not be on <br>
                just yet, but I applied myself I could do this, I can put in practice all that I have learn
                and seek a better future for me and my family.<br><br>

                Challenges we face daily they are a part of the way we learn, I know that I don't like to <br>
                face changes abruptly, it takes me time to figure out a strategy to adapt, it was funny that<br>
                in this class changes came at me so fast that I barley had time to think about it I adapted<br>
                every week to something new, I think that may have been the best way to learn to overcome<br>
                the fear of change. <br><br>

                I now feel that the change I will face soon, leaving the learning path and changing it to a <br>
                working field I have never done before can be possible I like programing, I may not be in my <br>
                future to work as a programmer, but I like to know that if I were to choose it as a profession <br>
                it will be something that I could do with more practice now I know that I could do it, this was <br>
                not as terrify as I thought it will be, learning to change has in the end changed me to trust <br>
                in myself and in my future.<br><br>
