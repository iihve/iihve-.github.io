        <h4>What is learning if not a daily path on our way back home.</h4>

        <div class="paragraph1">

            <p> Learning the materials of this class has been challenging but exciting.I did not only learn about
                the fourteen topics assigned by the class structure, but I learned a lot about myself, how do I  <br>
                react to different challenges and how to apply the concepts I acquired to make the programs <br>
                not only work but to have them behave how I expected to behave, checking myself for errors and behavior.<br><br>

                This has showed me how programs are structured why they are structured that way and how I <br>
                should put this in practice, this let me put together in my mind the knowledge I had gained true <br>
                out other classes, with a different perspective, one where practice reinforced that knowledge.<br><br>

                The learning process in this class is so different because it makes you aware of your team and<br>
                how important they are to succeed, as a student I have discovered new techniques to cooperate<br>
                in a team seat, our team started to get together like many others with some expectations and <br>
                some misunderstandings but quickly it became a functional team.<br><br>

                I learned to look forward to the meetings to learn from my colleagues and contribute as much <br>
                as I could to every ones progress to, by bouncing ideas and teaching concepts I had just <br>
                learned, it was exiting to put in practice what we were learning and to be able to see how others <br>
                worked and found solutions too.

                    <h4>By taking this class I have discovered new things about myself</h4>
                <P>
                    In the end, I have gained new knowledge of the kind that it will accompany me for the rest <br>
                    of my life, because I have learned so much about myself and the way I can succeed in learning.<br>
