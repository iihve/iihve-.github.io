    <p>
        I re-started my learning path some 7 years ago, I wanted to finish my education after a long<br>
        absence period to raise my family. I never imagine that technology could be an option for me,<br>
         but after learning how to turn on a computer (wen I went to school we only had typewriters) <br>
        my world to change.<br><br>

        Fast-forward to the beginning of this term, I was terrified of taking this class, I try before, <br>
        and I couldn't make sense of it, I have no idea why it was so hard, maybe it was just fear,but <br>
        the first time I end it by leaving the class. I felt a shame I had never failed in something<br>
        like this before, my moral level hit low, and I had to reevaluate my path, and make changes.<br><br>


        After praying for inspiration and understanding, I started again by reading the materials,  <br>
        and the structure of the class, I started to see things differently I felt that my instructor<br>
        was there to help and support me, and all that busted my confidence and energy, understanding<br>
        came gradually, and it I cloud finally work, not how I worked before but in a more substantial way.<br><br>
