        <h4>Thinking how to think and learning how to learn</h4>

        <div class="paragraph1">

            <p>This week I have been evaluating the things that I had accomplished in this class,and I have <br>
                come to understand that I need to acknowledge that I by myself I could not have accomplished <br>
                anything, I counted with the guidance of my adviser in the class who answer my many <br>
                questions and guided me to be the best I could and gave me the encouragement I needed to <br>
                keep going after failing the first time.<br><br>

                I to have had the support of my team, who worked tirelessly to teach and help each other <br>
                and showed how the programs worked, they made me feel an important part of the group, <br>
                and I counted with the support of my family, and The blessings of Heavenly Father to keep<br>
                 my mind clear and focused.<br><br>

                Knowing that I had this support team I work hard to learn and get to basic in all the topics,  <br>
                I may not have finished in time with all, but I try my best.<br><br>


                During this term, I set personal goals to achieve learning not only to pass the class but<br>
                to actually know how to succeed , and I stuck to those goals making a working schedule <br>
                and keeping to it, by doing this I learned to be productive in a set time, I prepared <br>
                materials for the benefit of others with professionalism care.<br><br>

                All this has made me a stronger person I can feel respect for my work ethic an, the fact<br>
                that I can learn for myself, but without being self centered, instead I have come to <br>
                understand that by being willing to teach others to succeed as a team we all progress <br>
                together in any kind of project.<br><br>

                I think of the accomplishments I have obtained I can see how they have improved the person <br>
                I am, and I see this as a firm foundation of the person I wanted to be from now on.<br><br>
