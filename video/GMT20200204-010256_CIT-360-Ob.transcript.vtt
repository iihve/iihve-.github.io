00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
Applications ever for this kind of stuff. It's amazing.

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.470
Marie de Guzman: Get

3
00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.379
Ixkra Estrada: On recording already

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.500
Yes, Korea to know

5
00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.099
Marie de Guzman: Yeah, just a couple more minutes and

6
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:14.309
Then

7
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.929
Ixkra Estrada: We'll start

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.300
Recording

9
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.360
Ixkra Estrada: Because we're recording. That's scary. But I think it's only my screen that is recording right now. I mean, it's not for everyone, but

10
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.730
Ixkra Estrada: My terrible profile or whatever the one that is required for

11
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.440
Lynn Dimick: Oh, that works.

12
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.590
Ixkra Estrada: Out There you go. How'd you do that.

13
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.000
Jeremy Blake: Now, my goodness.

14
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.460
Jeremy Blake: My other classes, does that

15
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.560
Lynn Dimick: You click on the up arrow to the right a video and you're

16
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.530
Marie de Guzman: Outside

17
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.120
Marie de Guzman: Outside Earth.

18
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.790
Ixkra Estrada: So funny.

19
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.240
Jeremy Blake: It clips every now and then. I don't know if it doesn't for everybody, or if it depends on lighting or background, but I've seen some pretty strange things to

20
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.900
Lynn Dimick: I've tried to do that for working it doesn't work as a US citizen. It's just too much leg.

21
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.090
Yeah.

22
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.960
Ixkra Estrada: But it will be really nice to have it because it doesn't look that professional recording from my bedroom.

23
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.480
Ixkra Estrada: Right now.

24
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.470
Jeremy Blake: It's a fireplace, though you have a fireplace in your bedroom.

25
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.790
Ixkra Estrada: That's my

26
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.980
Jeremy Blake: Board. Oh.

27
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.090
Jeremy Blake: Nice headboard well

28
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.140
Ixkra Estrada: Thank you. When, when we started the story was smaller and

29
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.250
Ixkra Estrada: Grew and as a like when they brought it here was like it's here.

30
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.030
Lynn Dimick: I work from home. Most of the time, my boss lets me but our boss's boss doesn't like it.

31
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.060
Lynn Dimick: Oh, I've got a flannel board that actually put on my bed behind me to cover all the Baxter, so he doesn't know where I am.

32
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.060
You think good baby.

33
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.470
Lynn Dimick: The work is two hours away.

34
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.700
Oh,

35
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.210
Lynn Dimick: I've been there twice since Halloween.

36
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.460
Ixkra Estrada: That's nice.

37
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.950
That's really nice. Okay.

38
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.620
Ixkra Estrada: Oh, yeah.

39
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.890
Ixkra Estrada: Let's start the

40
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.920
Ixkra Estrada: Meeting and

41
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.120
Ixkra Estrada: I'm gonna share my screen. And I'm going to share this one.

42
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.580
Can you all see it.

43
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.040
Jeremy Blake: Yeah yeah

44
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.970
Hansen: There started. Yeah, I see it. Yes.

45
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.420
Ixkra Estrada: So why he testing by myself for the software developers and it's a it has

46
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.130
You

47
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.050
Ixkra Estrada: Importance and I just wanted to illustrate it here with my mirror

48
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:30.780
Ixkra Estrada: Image of how you should go if if it were was going to work correctly, it will just start in do everything that it needs to be done and then landed perfectly

49
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:48.450
Ixkra Estrada: So why is it important because it ensures that the software works properly if it has not been tested it can house crashes after delivery and none of us wants that, because there was get really upset about that it's useful to find general failures.

50
00:03:49.620 --> 00:04:11.670
Ixkra Estrada: Because it will help us fix them in time and it helps developers to see if it works. He it works the way the client wants. So it's not just for us to find that we have mistakes on our coding, but it is for preparing for the user to have a great experience when they are using

51
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:24.900
Ixkra Estrada: No, the most common types of software testing our unit testing integration testing system testing and user testing system. This thing. It's called to high level blood

52
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:40.860
Ixkra Estrada: black box testing and I went to check. Why was named that way and I thought it was very interesting. There are black box texting like testing. Sorry, and white box testing.

53
00:04:42.870 --> 00:05:00.210
Ixkra Estrada: So system testing or high level but black box testing, its kind of a testing is done on an assembly application. It is generally done by executing the user interface when there is one when there is one where

54
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:09.210
Ixkra Estrada: It attempts to cover every line of code, including the Iranians uses of the functionality, the application provide

55
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:25.830
Ixkra Estrada: It is often done by sophisticated automated software or by human. So we're testers and for our case. I went more on human testing. I didn't knew that you can take classes and be a tester.

56
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.770
Ixkra Estrada: And professional this and just

57
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.770
Ixkra Estrada: Do that on your own all the time, but I thought that was very interesting and

58
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:51.450
Ixkra Estrada: So, it is also called black box testing because it is testing methadone without having knowledge of all the actual call or internal structure of the application.

59
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:59.490
Ixkra Estrada: And it is because the testers. Sometimes they just go and try and it is better. They don't know

60
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:18.450
Ixkra Estrada: Sometimes they have an idea because programs or systems are big and sometimes they know what they are about, but they don't know all the information and it is very useful to have them try it and they go line by line testing that it should do what we wanted to do.

61
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.100
So,

62
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:42.540
Ixkra Estrada: This is a high level testing, such as a functional testing it concentrates on the functionality on the system on their tests like boss box 16 testing requires specification on this black box testing is done by testers, obviously. So keep going here and

63
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:57.510
Ixkra Estrada: A simple system level this this simply in case of human thriving system level testing, she'll be readable by users normally outline aligning what the user should do and see

64
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:08.850
Ixkra Estrada: This thurs don't necessarily know, like I was saying, the application. They are higher to test it is advisable to create your test with at least two columns. What this offense to specify

65
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:29.820
Ixkra Estrada: The steps to follow and what result they should see number to match the steps in both columns with one on one relationship and I found this example here is the one that it's in the book, so I can a copier so we can have a good idea on how does it work and

66
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.910
Ixkra Estrada: He told number and then you can see

67
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:43.320
Ixkra Estrada: If you can see my cursor, but it's moving very but this one is where we put the description of what are the what the person, the

68
00:07:44.430 --> 00:08:04.890
Ixkra Estrada: Company would stay on the development story. That's the technical development puts what he should do in the next column, the testers specifies what he seen that he does so I thought it was very interesting. And so I did my own and I don't know if you can see it.

69
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.470
Ixkra Estrada: I have a crazy document.

70
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.070
Ixkra Estrada: But I wrote a little simple program.

71
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.590
Ixkra Estrada: To calculate

72
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:38.160
Ixkra Estrada: The wages, the net pay of a person after tax were taken off and then I tried it and it work line by line, the way I wanted it to work. That was great until I got to the last part. So I did find a mistake. Everything here in the list. What I wanted to do.

73
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:45.330
Ixkra Estrada: It fast everything did well. But in any ways had the and I find out that there was a mistake.

74
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.790
Ixkra Estrada: So what was the mistake.

75
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.770
Ixkra Estrada: The system is working perfectly. It did all

76
00:08:53.880 --> 00:09:04.050
Ixkra Estrada: We're looking for number by number. So the program works well. But there was a mistake. Like I said, and the last example, the information to the user was incomplete.

77
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:13.290
Ixkra Estrada: And it was interesting to me. I mean, I wrote it. So I shouldn't have known about here for a moment. I shouldn't have known.

78
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.740
Ixkra Estrada: How to express the

79
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.910
Ixkra Estrada: That, that's what that was going to be with help.

80
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.410
Ixkra Estrada: But I did the percentages and i'm wrong way.

81
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:26.970
Ixkra Estrada: And

82
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.770
He's one is not that one. But anyways, he's in

83
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:40.920
Ixkra Estrada: And it gave me an amount that it says that I was owning or the person was owning

84
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:56.010
Ixkra Estrada: A lot to the tax collector because it wasn't a specified anywhere, how to pull the hell to enter the race. So it didn't, it wasn't a specified to pull

85
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:03.450
Ixkra Estrada: a.no yeah to separate the percentage. So if you know

86
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.090
Ixkra Estrada: You already know how to present the percentages in this month.

87
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:26.070
Ixkra Estrada: Then you'll get it right. But if you don't know and non all the users know that so he did it wrong. So I found a mistake is not a big mistake. But it is a mistake and system tests are done to find mistakes that is specifically what they are for

88
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:34.020
Ixkra Estrada: Programs will always have mistakes or problems and the users will find them no matter what we do.

89
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:47.070
Ixkra Estrada: When we present it to the users, they'll find something they'll complain about something either the lie that it could be cosmetic or it can be in the system. So this helps us to find all those mistakes in the system before

90
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:56.340
Ixkra Estrada: It gets to the user will funnel user and it is. That's why it is so important for us to know this and use them.

91
00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.670
And this is my presentation. And the question.

92
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.690
Lynn Dimick: Can you go back to the definition of black box testing.

93
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.420
Yes. No.

94
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.340
Lynn Dimick: Okay, so it's basically done by somebody that doesn't know.

95
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:23.700
Lynn Dimick: how it's supposed to work. You give them a script or set of instructions to follow and then the record the results. Exactly. Okay.

96
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:33.450
Ixkra Estrada: And for what I read from white box testing. It's the completely different and they know exactly what it is supposed to go and they go

97
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:46.920
Ixkra Estrada: Fixing line by line that things are finding. So that's they have all the information, but you need in black box testing is you need to know. So you can find things you're like, Oh, interesting. Let's see how it works.

98
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.840
Yeah. Yeah. Any other questions.

99
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:56.820
Marie de Guzman: That I can think of.

100
00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.110
Yeah.

101
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.650
Marie de Guzman: Yeah, I was really good.

102
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:13.860
Marie de Guzman: You accidentally started well but I do what I can. I did. Yeah, I did a presentation on this so that semester and there's just more detailed

103
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:16.890
Marie de Guzman: Well done.

104
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.810
Ixkra Estrada: Okay, no. Now,

105
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:24.900
Ixkra Estrada: Blamed

106
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.130
Ixkra Estrada: For me, yes.

107
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.020
Ixkra Estrada: Okay, this

108
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.450
Lynn Dimick: Is where it gets interesting.

109
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.370
Lynn Dimick: Let me

110
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.890
See if I can

111
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.230
Lynn Dimick: Can you can you

112
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.590
Lynn Dimick: Share. Yes.

113
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.700
Ixkra Estrada: I think you can get enough

114
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.610
Hansen: Think you have to do your share for him to do it.

115
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.480
Ixkra Estrada: I'm sorry. Yes, share files and stuff.

116
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:23.400
Lynn Dimick: All right, here's, here's what happened is I spent most of Saturday, trying to track down this this Android HTTP URL connection.

117
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:42.180
Lynn Dimick: And I found some code on how to do it, but it's more of a example of how the guy did it without using the libraries and things like that. And so I spent today trying to get into it and I found this website called the open tutorials. Can everybody see that on my screen. Yes.

118
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:52.920
Lynn Dimick: And what's happened is, is that it looks like we put the cart before the horse because this is actually talking about creating a serve let

119
00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:54.840
Lynn Dimick: And what the

120
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.590
Lynn Dimick: Based upon what I was able to determine

121
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:09.450
Lynn Dimick: The HTTP requests that were being used with Java, we're not covering all the needs and requirements they had. And so what they did is they went to

122
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:21.270
Lynn Dimick: They created a customer personal or an updated library specific for Android and instead of using URLs. They're using you our eyes.

123
00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:33.090
Lynn Dimick: And what the UI does is allows it to pass less specific information and include other things in it, other than HTTP. So, for example,

124
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:51.870
Lynn Dimick: If part of your application is to call a telephone application, you would put te L colon and then the phone number, instead of HTTP. So it's got a little bit different. Use in it behaves very differently. Now the other thing that happens is that within the server, let

125
00:14:53.580 --> 00:15:04.020
Lynn Dimick: You have an XML file and the XML file is being used to define things such as the buttons. The sizes and things like that. And what's being shared.

126
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.530
Lynn Dimick: So you've got a package there that has to be assembled and put the other

127
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:20.250
Lynn Dimick: You've got the different code that has to go into it. The you've got a lot of different imports, I think I counted at one time, about a dozen imports and then you've got the code for it. There's a sample of all the inputs that go into it.

128
00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:29.880
Lynn Dimick: And so you're actually you're, you're, you have to build the string of what it is you're sending and then you have to send it

129
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:37.620
Lynn Dimick: In the, the, one of the ways that it behaves differently is that it's asynchronous. There's an easy task.

130
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:50.850
Lynn Dimick: Which allows it to run the background so it does not have to be running the foreground at all times. So if you're telling it to pull data, it can pull that you can also do it in streams so you don't have to adjust the entire thing all at once.

131
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:56.040
Lynn Dimick: So this long convoluted exclamation explanation.

132
00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:12.090
Lynn Dimick: However you want to describe it basically says that I'm not prepared to discuss this because I'm not familiar with athletes yet or Surveillance. Surveillance and so I need your guy's help in pulling this together and figure out how we can move forward.

133
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.480
Ixkra Estrada: So does anybody has experienced with each

134
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.800
Ixkra Estrada: Or discipline, so we can understand and ongoing

135
00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:30.510
Lynn Dimick: Row is your spring.

136
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.290
Semester.

137
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:55.710
Marie de Guzman: Yeah, I, I worked on this last semester and I'm having troubles with split this semester I wanted you know successfully run everything that I've already done last semester but because I have a new ID and not sure what I was doing was what I'm doing there. Yeah, doesn't run anymore but

138
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.100
Ixkra Estrada: But didn't run when you were using Eclipse.

139
00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.130
Marie de Guzman: Yes, yes, actually have a

140
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.560
Marie de Guzman: Me see if I can find it.

141
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:15.630
Lynn Dimick: She goes, Bruce I had last year in the JavaScript class was that I was cutting and pasting code from the book and I wasn't working. And as soon as I put a new cliffs, all of a sudden it was working

142
00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.450
Marie de Guzman: It's just, it's set up differently in

143
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:39.600
Marie de Guzman: Like the folder structure is different. And there are, there's this idea of older, not just source folder right SRC, so it works differently. I'm trying to find. Okay. I do have some

144
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:53.520
Marie de Guzman: I do have some links that might help my YouTube link that shows my demonstration of the program. I made last semester yeah I were, can I put it right

145
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.570
Ixkra Estrada: On your screen then

146
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.110
I did.

147
00:17:59.250 --> 00:17:59.640
Marie de Guzman: Okay.

148
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:07.380
Marie de Guzman: I also sent the link to the chat, chat box. Okay, so

149
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.650
Marie de Guzman: You won't hear my you won't hear the audio from my computer right

150
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.420
Marie de Guzman: Well, you can try it. Okay.

151
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.850
Aaron Wright: You can share and

152
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:29.310
Aaron Wright: Also share the computer audio. There's just a checkbox that you have to click

153
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.550
Marie de Guzman: OK, you'll have to guide me through it.

154
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:46.080
Marie de Guzman: You can pause first and then I was trying to find that option you can help me try to find that option.

155
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.940
Marie de Guzman: Yeah, so you

156
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.080
Aaron Wright: Have to

157
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.540
Aaron Wright: Click it. When you first start sharing

158
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.090
Marie de Guzman: Okay, let me do that against top share and then

159
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.580
Marie de Guzman: Share screen share computer. SOUND Okay, yeah.

160
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.250
Hansen: You probably did try it and see.

161
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.070
Marie de Guzman: Okay.

162
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.890
Marie de Guzman: See, can you see my screen.

163
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:23.880
Ixkra Estrada: There.

164
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:26.160
Hansen: We go.

165
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:40.320
Marie de Guzman: Hi. So in this video I'm going to demonstrate to you, Slava Rubin muted that will take a response from this webpage and process that request using this serlet

166
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:57.180
Marie de Guzman: That I created and what we will do for processing is that will take a request the request as the for for first name and last name and then have that processed as a pending to create a full name with a format of

167
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.430
The format of last name, comma, and first name.

168
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:19.320
Okay, so I have this and if I have here and if else condition conditional statements to make sure that the field is not empty to process to request both fields are not empty, if they are empty.

169
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:33.360
Because this is the fact that it will say, make sure fields are not empty, and we should be able to go back and correct that to the process to the request and see what questions.

170
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:40.380
It.

171
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:57.960
Will respond with these this output in an HTML format as well. And yeah, we'll provide us that process data, which is the full name. And by the way, my service is using

172
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:11.520
Deployment descriptor here an XML file, which will basically just let Tomcat know what kind of service, we are requesting. And in this case, this only one a pen solid

173
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.660
Solid. Okay, let's try this works.

174
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.660
Can I have to restart my server here.

175
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.030
Let me see the happy path first

176
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:32.340
Enter my

177
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.540
First name, last name it. Sorry.

178
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.720
So very simple program just to demonstrate that it processes that the request.

179
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:59.220
And then, yeah, it says a response with full name. And what if it's not a happy path. Let's see. One is blank. Make sure fields are not empty so i i go back and correct that, um,

180
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:10.860
Marie de Guzman: And it will do the happy path, right. So yeah, that's all and have a good day. Okay, so it's very simple.

181
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:20.730
Marie de Guzman: And that made it to basic level, and maybe I can share you some information here general information.

182
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:30.390
Marie de Guzman: This is what I wrote in the family rarity review so surplus are used for dynamic web projects.

183
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:42.960
Marie de Guzman: Okay, that takes a response. So what I did was a simple survey program that takes the response using an HTML file or form.

184
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:54.720
Marie de Guzman: And have a serlet process that request using Tomcat So Tom Cat is the server. I'm used in in our Java program access a web container.

185
00:22:55.530 --> 00:23:03.150
Marie de Guzman: And it responds to that request by using print writer object to create an HTML view with a response.

186
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:13.950
Marie de Guzman: So when we create a self serve lead. It's like creating a class that extensive with HTTP server that we import the packages, create a method in

187
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:36.270
Marie de Guzman: In my sample. I used to do get and then we pass through parameters within the server service of HTTP server, which are request and response. We can then pass the response using a print writer object to display out. So I have a GitHub link here as well. And I can forward to you.

188
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.240
Marie de Guzman: There are three components to it. So I had a web container.

189
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:55.710
Marie de Guzman: Web dot XML and index dot HTML for like the the client view and this is the back end stuff the plan.

190
00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:58.380
Marie de Guzman: Last

191
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.310
Marie de Guzman: That access to serve program.

192
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:09.810
Marie de Guzman: Well, that's because I'm assigned to. Yeah, to teach this topic next week. Or when is it

193
00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:18.810
Marie de Guzman: 18. Yeah. Make sure I review it and understand it again because it's been awhile.

194
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:20.850
Ixkra Estrada: Okay.

195
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.290
Ixkra Estrada: Okay, so did you do the

196
00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.480
Ixkra Estrada: The Android HTTP URL.

197
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:41.820
Marie de Guzman: I did HTTP URL, but I didn't use Android technology for that.

198
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:43.800
Marie de Guzman: Check.

199
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.540
Marie de Guzman: And these are for

200
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.180
Marie de Guzman: Yeah, I got today sick as well.

201
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.070
Ixkra Estrada: Without their

202
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:55.530
Marie de Guzman: paste the link. Yeah. It's also very simple and I would say it's it's a dumb.

203
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:10.500
Marie de Guzman: But, but, you know, it, it kind of demonstrates demonstrates the point that okay I learned that HTTP is a protocol using the internet follows client server model and

204
00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:23.640
Marie de Guzman: You know, I just did the requirement, the minimum requirement which is to demonstrate like happy path and sad path with it to make sure you know how to use HTTP get an HTTP post

205
00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:25.860
Marie de Guzman: Yeah, so

206
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.860
Marie de Guzman: I have a YouTube

207
00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:36.420
Marie de Guzman: Video is very short. Yeah. Can you try to show that. Yeah, I can try to share it again.

208
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.860
Marie de Guzman: Sure, no worries.

209
00:25:53.460 --> 00:26:14.100
Hi. So in this Java program. I'm going to show to you that I created a Java program using open the okay HTTP client to demonstrate my basic understanding of HTTP topic for Java. So what it's going to do is going to

210
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.010
Request

211
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:27.420
This web. Web, it's going to connect to this website and it's going to get data for this.

212
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:41.880
Then we're going to display that into the console right like Jason format.

213
00:26:42.780 --> 00:27:00.480
And the happy path for this when it's not a contact when we cannot contact this specific URL or if this is incorrect, that it would say website cannot be contacted or otherwise, it's going to print the data that is requested from this website as a string.

214
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.580
Alright, so let's try it. Let's try to run this.

215
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.240
Takes a little bit, but here we go. So as you can see

216
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:19.470
It.

217
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.880
Marie de Guzman: If we have a typo in here and

218
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.600
Marie de Guzman: This time it says website cannot be contacted

219
00:27:49.770 --> 00:28:01.680
Marie de Guzman: Have a good day. Again, sorry. So it's very high. So the program. I'm going to maybe you could search that the jar file for it. Okay, HTTP three and yeah

220
00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:20.910
Marie de Guzman: You'll be able to write a program like this and to be able to allow you to utilize the dots your arrow function of it. And, you know, to be able to get data from a website and then return that data into JSON format or

221
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:28.230
Marie de Guzman: Yeah, whatever format you can they get. And then if you break the URL or if you

222
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.510
Marie de Guzman: Contact their website.

223
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:07.620
Marie de Guzman: Okay, so I sent all the links in the chat and I could just copy it.

224
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:16.170
Marie de Guzman: Yeah, maybe you could copy to this group discussion board for everyone to see.

225
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.610
Ixkra Estrada: Perfect, thank you so much. Now, will help us.

226
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:21.390
We can all

227
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.100
Ixkra Estrada: Right.

228
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.450
Marie de Guzman: Yeah.

229
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.800
Hopefully, they don't make sense.

230
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.480
Marie de Guzman: It's

231
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.900
Ixkra Estrada: If we all support each other. We will, we can get there.

232
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:35.670
Ixkra Estrada: Don't despair.

233
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.840
Marie de Guzman: Is anybody. Yes, yes.

234
00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.350
Ixkra Estrada: That was the video. I think you in the video Westfield

235
00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:44.700
Marie de Guzman: Yeah I close

236
00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.570
Marie de Guzman: It out a place. Let's challenge.

237
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:52.020
Ixkra Estrada: Maybe it's in a loop sometimes

238
00:29:53.460 --> 00:30:02.580
Ixkra Estrada: I leave mine on a loop. Some people. So one go to all their videos and some people don't get bothered by other weird stuff.

239
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.230
Marie de Guzman: So I just

240
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.670
Marie de Guzman: Normally, take a look.

241
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:13.920
Ixkra Estrada: Okay, okay. So anything else anyone anybody else that's to add or questions or anything.

242
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:19.860
Lynn Dimick: Jeremy, how are you doing out there, Aaron. How are you doing Hanson as everybody else doing

243
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:31.380
Jeremy Blake: I missed basic and you ML diagrams, because I guess I missed the mark. Just need to take some time to go back and he hasn't checked last week's yet for me.

244
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.060
Ixkra Estrada: Yeah, no, he hasn't changed much as we

245
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.640
Lynn Dimick: Try to set up a meeting with him for tonight and he turns out he's on the East Coast this week so

246
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.250
Lynn Dimick: He's traveling for business. I'm not sure how much responsible get back room. This week I know we'll try

247
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:51.960
Hansen: This, in my fluency.

248
00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:56.790
Hansen: So turn one this weekend let y'all know how it's

249
00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:58.920
Hansen: All right.

250
00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.980
Lynn Dimick: I'm way behind. I'm going to be turning in a bunch of this week so

251
00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:06.270
Ixkra Estrada: Experience.

252
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:13.980
Ixkra Estrada: Yeah, no, I didn't get the basic on the first two topics been waiting for the next ones. I know I'm

253
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:21.240
Ixkra Estrada: Not going to get basic on the program that I sent him because he has a mistake. Yeah. And I just wanted him to tell me

254
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:36.420
Ixkra Estrada: Know how to fix it. But what his opinion was he, and so I will wait for his advice on how to continue on that one. I know. I believe it's a syntax means mistake, what I have. But I'll always do what he says and then go from there.

255
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:47.400
Ixkra Estrada: But I will work on this week, so I don't get stuck. I would have to remember that at the end of the 10 weeks if we can make it to basic we will pass the class with a C. But

256
00:31:48.360 --> 00:32:01.740
Ixkra Estrada: If we haven't done everything we will have all those four weeks to finish the things that we need to finish to. But if we can make it all the way and do the product that will be me. I know everybody's shooting for that, but

257
00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:19.410
Ixkra Estrada: Let's try to do whatever we can. And if we support each other and we have questions that we can ask between each other like right now. Money has guys us a lot to the simple problems. I think we over complicated because we want to do big thing.

258
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.870
Marie de Guzman: Yeah, just it simply

259
00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:36.960
