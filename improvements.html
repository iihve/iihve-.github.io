        <div class="paragraph1">

            <p>
                One things I did not get to do, was the application, since I did not finish on time all the topics, <br>
                but that does not mean that I won't do it.<br><br>

                Since I started to learn computer science I have had the idea of creating an application, now  <br>
                that I have a better idea how to do it, I will work on getting this done.<br><br>

                this application will reunite many of the characteristics of the topics we learned alone with <br>
                the knowledge I have acquired during my learning path, I'm confident I will get it done.<br><br>

                To do this I still have to keep growing, and keep learning, If I stay still all the knowledge <br>
                and practice I have done will just erase from my mind, so I will need to keep improving by <br>
                researching and using the techniques I have obtained. <br><br>

                I think this new way of thinking to think and learning to learn will only be kept by <br>
                acting on it like faith actions will make it grow<br><br>

                That is how I can keep improving, by each day looking to a new horizon and be prepared to face <br>
                new challenges, that is where to improve as a person and as a professional will be a daily goal.<br><br>
